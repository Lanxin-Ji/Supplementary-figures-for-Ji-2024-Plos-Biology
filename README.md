S1 Fig. The gray matter mask and the functional atlas used in our RSFC analysis. Preprocessed fetal 
and infant data sets were masked by a gray matter mask and then submitted to the SLIC toolbox 
(https://www.nitrc.org/projects/slic/) to generate a data-driven, group-balanced
functional atlas consisting of 195 functional parcels, as shown in S1 Fig. The gray matter mask
was adapted from dHCP infant tissue template.


S2 Fig. The distribution of age-related resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) based
on Euclidean distance. The Euclidean distance of RSFC is computed using the square root of
the sum of squared differences between the central coordinates of corresponding ROIs. In this
figure, regions with positive age-related RSFC are depicted in red, while those with negative
age-related RSFC are depicted in blue. The figure does not exhibit a discernible contrast
between the positively and negatively age-related RSFC, suggesting that distance may not be a
significant factor influencing the increase or decrease of RSFC with age.


S3 Fig. TSNR analysis. We conducted tSNR analyses on fetal and infant data sets, and the
resulting plot of average SNR across networks is provided here. When we analyzed the signal
and noise separately, we found that the mean signal levels (middle column in the figure below)
are quite comparable between the fetal and infant data sets. However, the fetal data exhibits
higher variance, indicating increased noise. This outcome aligns with the challenges typical in 
fetal imaging.


S4 Fig. Quality control analysis of the final sample. This figure shows that the average
RSFC-motion-distance correlation is negligible (< Â± 0.2).


S5 Fig. A lollipop plot and a distribution plot of scan ages. The lollipop plot displays each
participant as a row, with points indicating visit times, color-coded as shown in the legend.
Males are represented in blue, and females in pink. Separate density plots for participant ages
are also provided for both fetal and infant MRI scans.


S6 Fig. Effects of LongCombat Harmonization. (A) Additive effects of different sequences
before and after applying LongCombat. (B) Comparison of positively age-related RSFC before
and after LongCombat. (C) Comparison of negatively age-related RSFC before and after LongCombat
